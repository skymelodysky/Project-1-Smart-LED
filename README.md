# Project-1-Smart-LED
The Smart LED project uses CircuitPython and NeoPixel strips with a WIZNET5K module to create an interactive lighting system. Users can remotely control the LEDs via Adafruit IO, adjusting colors and states in real-time. This project is perfect for beginners, introducing IoT concepts while allowing for creative applications.
