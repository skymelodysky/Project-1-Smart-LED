# Project-1-Smart-LED
The Smart LED project combines CircuitPython and NeoPixel strips with a WIZNET5K module to create an interactive and customizable lighting system. This project allows users to remotely control the LEDs through Adafruit IO, offering features like turning the lights on and off and changing colors in real-time.

By using Thonny to write and upload the code, users can easily set up an MQTT connection to subscribe to specific feeds for LED control. This project serves as an excellent introduction to programming and electronics, making it ideal for beginners.

The Smart LED can be adapted for various creative applications, such as mood lighting, decorative displays, or notification systems, showcasing the versatility of IoT technologies in everyday life.
